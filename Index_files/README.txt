This folder contrains index files for all the datasets used. Index files are .txt files that can opened with any text editor. More information on the data sets and their sources can be found in the report PDF.

Description of each file:
carbonic_anhydrase.txt: Test file of 214 carbonic anhydrase complexes from the PDBbind 2016 refined set. eft column is the PDB ID of the complex and the right column in the binding affinity.

CASF_coreset2016.txt: The core set of 209 complexes from the supplementary files of the publication Minysi Su et al. JCIM 2019 (ACS). Left column is the PDB ID of the complex and the right column in the binding affinity.

HIV_protease.txt: Test file of 280 HIV-1 protease complexes from the PDBbind 2016 refined set. Left column is the PDB ID of the complex and the right column in the binding affinity.
